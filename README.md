# Kendra-Ward-Portfolio-2025

## About The Project

This project was built to showcase my front-end developer personal projects. Building my portfolio from scratch gave me the ability to display the technical and web design skills I have learned. I was able to implement JavaScript functions and CSS selectors I was not previously familiar with.

- I plan to update my portfolio with new features and project as i continue to build upon my skillset.

### Built With
